# My Private Cloud Project

## Introduction
In the era of digital transformation, cloud computing plays a crucial role in delivering flexible, scalable, and cost-efficient infrastructure. For organizations that require full control over their data, enhanced security, and proactive resource management, Private Cloud emerges as an ideal solution.

OpenStack is a powerful open-source platform that enables the deployment of Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) environments. It offers a variety of core services, such as:
+ Nova - Virtual machine management
+ Neutron - Virtual network management
+ Cinder - Block storage management
+ Glance - Image management
+ Keystone - Authentication and authorization
+ Horizon - Web-based dashboard for administration

## Objectives:
In this project, a Private Cloud system will be deployed on Ubuntu 22.04 with a scale of 1â€“2 nodes, ensuring the following core capabilities:
- Manage, create, delete, and modify virtual machines (VMs).
- Create, delete, modify, and configure virtual networking.
- Integrate and operate a Block Storage system within the OpenStack environment.
